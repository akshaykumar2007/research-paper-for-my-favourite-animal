\begin{abstract}
Dolphins are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and playful nature. This research paper explores various aspects of dolphins, including their habitat, diet, social structure, and conservation efforts. The aim is to present a comprehensive understanding of these remarkable marine mammals.

\section{Introduction}
Dolphins are highly social and intelligent marine mammals that belong to the family Delphinidae. They are found in oceans and rivers across the world and are known for their friendly interaction with humans. Dolphins have fascinated scientists and the general public alike due to their complex behaviors and communication abilities.

\section{Habitat and Distribution}
Dolphins are widely distributed across the world's oceans, particularly in warmer waters. Some species, such as the Bottlenose Dolphin, are also found in coastal regions and river systems.

\subsection{Oceanic Dolphins}
Oceanic dolphins are commonly found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They tend to stay near the surface, where they can hunt for fish and squid.

\subsection{River Dolphins}
Some species, like the Amazon River Dolphin, inhabit freshwater rivers. These dolphins have adapted to murky waters and often use echolocation to navigate and find prey.

\section{Diet and Behavior}
Dolphins are carnivorous animals, primarily feeding on fish, squid, and crustaceans. They are known for their playful behavior, such as riding waves and leaping out of the water.

\subsection{Social Structure}
Dolphins are social animals that live in groups called pods. These pods can range from a few individuals to over a hundred dolphins. They communicate using clicks, whistles, and body language.

\subsection{Echolocation}
One of the most remarkable features of dolphins is their use of echolocation to find food and navigate. By emitting sound waves, they can detect objects and animals even in complete darkness.

\section{Conservation Status}
Many dolphin species face threats from human activities, such as fishing, pollution, and habitat destruction. Conservation efforts are being made to protect these intelligent creatures.

\section{Hypothesis about Dolphins}
It is hypothesized that dolphins use echolocation not only for navigation and hunting but also for social communication within pods. This unique ability might contribute to their complex social behaviors and cooperative hunting strategies.

\section{Mathematical Estimation of Lifespan}
The lifespan of a dolphin can vary depending on species, environment, and threats. For the purpose of this paper, we introduce a formula to estimate the lifespan (\textit{L}) of a dolphin based on environmental factors (\textit{E}), predation risk (\textit{P}), and food availability (\textit{F}):

\begin{equation}
L = \frac{100 \times F}{E + P}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{F} = Food availability (rated from 1 to 10)
    \item \textit{E} = Environmental factors (pollution, habitat loss, rated from 1 to 10)
    \item \textit{P} = Predation risk (rated from 1 to 10)
\end{itemize}

For example, if a dolphin lives in an environment with high food availability (\textit{F} = 8), moderate environmental threats (\textit{E} = 5), and low predation risk (\textit{P} = 3), the estimated lifespan would be:

\[
L = \frac{100 \times 8}{5 + 3} = 100 \,
\]
